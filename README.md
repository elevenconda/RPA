# RPA
![](./RPAç¤ºä¾‹å›¾.PNG)
A method that aligns relation paths generated by LLMs with canonical relations across multiple knowledge graphs. RPA performs this alignment through relation normalization, KG-side index construction, and a dual-stage semantic matching strategy.
RPA-KGQA: Relation Path Alignment for Multi-Knowledge-Graph QA

This project implements the Relation Path Alignment (RPA) module for aligning large language model (LLM)-generated relation paths to heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGs), enabling robust and interpretable reasoning across multiple graphs.

ðŸ§© Features

- Unified path normalization
- Dual-stage relation matching (string + semantic)
- Multi-KG querying
- User-in-the-loop answer selection
